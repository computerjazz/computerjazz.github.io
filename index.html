            I’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience building
            cross-platform mobile apps, full-stack web apps, and AI-powered
            workflows. I love collaborating across disciplines—especially at the
            intersection of engineering, product, and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve worked extensively with React Native, React, and modern
            TypeScript stacks, but I’m always exploring new tools and
            technologies—including computer vision, microcontrollers, and
            infrared sensors. I have authored several open source packages that
            are used extensively across the React Native ecosystem.

                  No typing, no menus, no buttons — simply hover your device
                  over a word in your book and its definition will appear on the
                  screen. Defind is designed to be used with one hand, so you
                  never have to put down your book or magazine.
